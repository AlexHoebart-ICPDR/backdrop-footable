# FooTable Module

## Installation

The FooTables plugin requires 

Download and install version 7.x-2.3-alpha1 of the jQuery Update module. Enable the module. Visit the settings page (Administration » Configuration » Development » jQuery update). In testing early versions of this module, using jQuery version 1.8 caused some odd behavior in the Views UI, so version 1.7 is recommended instead.

## Credits

This module is largely based on code from the DataTables module. Many thanks to duellj for developing and contributing that module.
